# Achievable Engineering Management

This repo cotains a copy of my final year project report and associated files for the Masters of Engineering at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT).

The aim of this project was to develop a tool or list of tools which could be used by hardware startups to help identify and avoid the most common pitfalls suffered by startups.

The final result of this project was the "New Product Development Score Card". A simple flowchart designed to prompt the user to evaluate their project/product against each of the most common problems faced by startups, and make decisions on when to proceed based on their subjective score. The tool should be printed out and then used to brainstorm each issue with the entire team. The goal of the team is to provide enough structure to help avoid common pitfalls, without requiring a large investment of time or resources.
